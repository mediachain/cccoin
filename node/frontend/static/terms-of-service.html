<p class="c0"><span class="c2">10.1. &nbsp;As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide in-browser (or otherwise local) software that (a) generates and stores CCCoin ACCOUNT Addresses and encrypted Private Keys (defined below), and (b) Facilitates the submission of CCCoin transaction data to the CCCoin network running on the Ethereum Blockchain and Network (the &ldquo;Ethereum Network&rdquo;) without requiring you to access the CCCoin command line interface. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">10.2. &nbsp;Account Names and Private Keys. When you create an Account, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive CCCoin via the Ethereum Network. The Private Key uniquely matches the Account Name and must be used in connection with the Account Name to authorize the transfer of CCCoin from that Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Private Key and any password phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your Account, password phrase and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of CCCoins associated with the Wallet.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">10.3. &nbsp;No Password Retrieval. Mediachain Labs does not receive or store your Account password, nor the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account password retrieval.</span><span

</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">22.1. Binding Arbitration</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Mediachain Labs: (a) waive your right to have any and all disputes or Claims arising from these Terms or Mediachain Labs (collectively, &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) resolved in a court; and (b) waive your right to a jury trial.

</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">22.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions, or Representative Actions</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">YOU AND MEDIACHAIN LABS AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND MEDIACHAIN LABS AND THAT ANY SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED SOLELY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
